# CLI presentation about Linus Toward

I was assigned to do presentation about Linus Toward for one school course. I decided to take do it in nerd/Linux way through presentation in command line.

To run the presentation [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) is required. 

To lunch the presentation run the `run.sh` script.
